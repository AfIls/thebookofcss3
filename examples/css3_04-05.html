<h2>Wuthering Heights</h2>
<p>I have just returned from a visit to my landlord--the solitary neighbour that I shall be troubled with.</p>
<p>This is certainly a beautiful country!</p>
<p>In all England, I do not believe that I could have fixed on a situation so completely removed from the stir of society.</p>
