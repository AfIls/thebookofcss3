    <h2>About The Book</h2>
    <p><img src="/wp-content/uploads/2011/03/bookofcss3-100.png" alt="The Book of CSS3 cover" height="132" width="100"> CSS3 is the latest revi­sion of Cas­cad­ing Style Sheets, the lan­guage used to define the appear­ance and lay­out of web doc­u­ments. A still-evolving stand­ard, CSS3 pre­sents a mov­ing tar­get for de­vel­o­pers who need to stay abreast of which fea­tures are sup­por­ted by par­tic­u­lar web browsers.</p>
    <p><em>The Book of CSS3</em> uses real-world examples to teach the fun­da­men­tals of the CSS3 spec­i­fi­ca­tion, high­light­ing the latest de­vel­op­ments and future fea­tures, while pay­ing close atten­tion to cur­rent browser implementations.</p>
    <p>Each chapter exam­ines a dif­fer­ent CSS3 mod­ule, and teaches the read­er to use excit­ing new fea­tures like web fonts, back­ground images, gradi­ents, 2D and 3D trans­for­ma­tions, an­i­mat­ion, box effects, and more.</p>
    <p>With in-depth code samples and detailed illus­tra­tions, <em>The Book of CSS3</em> doesn’t waste time teach­ing the basics of the lan­guage, focus­ing instead on the ground-breaking new pos­sib­il­it­ies that CSS3 brings to the world of web design.</p>
