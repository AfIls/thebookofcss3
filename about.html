  <h2>About The Book</h2>
  <div class="columns">
    <p><img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/images/bookofcss3-100.png" alt="The Book of CSS3 cover" height="132" width="100"> CSS3 is the technology behind many of the most eye-catching visuals on the Web. But the docs can be dry, murky, full of dastardly caveats for inconsistent browser implementations.</p>
    <p>The completely updated second edition of the best-selling <strong>Book of CSS3</strong> distills the dense technical language of the CSS3 specification into plain English and shows you what CSS3 can do now, in all major browsers. You’ll find revised coverage of gradients, grids, and flexible box layout, as well as all-new chapters on emerging layout features, like values and sizing, and
graphical effects, like filter effects and blend modes.</p>
    <p>With an abundance of real-world examples and a focus on the principles of good design, <strong>The Book of CSS3</strong> will help you expand your CSS skills, as you learn how to:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Style text with custom font choices, drop shadows, and other effects</li>
      <li>Create, position, and resize background images on the fly</li>
      <li>Spice up static web pages with event-driven transitions and animations</li>
      <li>Apply 2D and 3D transformations to text and images</li>
      <li>Use linear and radial gradients to create smooth color transitions</li>
      <li>Take control of layout with grids, columns, and flexible alignment</li>
      <li>Tailor a website’s appearance to every type of web-capable device</li>
    </ul>

  <h2>About The Second Edition</h2>
  <div class="columns">
    <p>The second edition of <strong>The Book of CSS3</strong> is not just an update but a complete overhaul, with every chapter reviewed, edited and improved.</p>
    <p>There are two new chapters: <em>Values and Sizing</em>; and <em>Blend Modes, Filter Effects and Masking</em>. A further four chapters have been almost entirely rewritten to bring them fully up to date with the latest changes to the CSS specification: <em>Gradients</em>; <em>Flexible Box Layout</em>; <em>Grid Layout</em>; and <em>The Future of CSS</em>.</p>
    <p>The remaining chapters have been heavily edited to remove non-standard proprietary vendor-prefixed properties, to remove out-of-date references to browser-specific implementations, and to add new illustrations and examples. The browser support tables have all been updated to include the very latest data on implementation.</p>
