        <p>Buck did not read the news&shy;papers, or he would have known that trouble was brew&shy;ing, not a&shy;lone for himself, but for every tide-water dog, strong of muscle and with warm, long hair, from Puget Sound to San Diego. Be&shy;cause men, groping in the Arc&shy;tic dark&shy;ness, had found a yellow metal, and because steam&shy;ship and transportation com&shy;pan&shy;ies were booming the find, thou&shy;sands of men were rushing into the&nbsp;Northland.</p>
		<p>These men wanted dogs, and the dogs they wanted were heavy dogs, with strong muscles by which to toil, and furry coats to protect them from the&nbsp;frost.</p>
		<p>Buck lived at a big house in the sun-kissed Santa Clara Val&shy;ley. Judge Miller's place, it was called. It stood back from the road, half hidden among the trees, through which glimps&shy;es could be caught of the wide cool veranda that ran around its four sides. The house was ap&shy;proached by gravelled driveways which wound about through wide-spread&shy;ing lawns and under the interlacing boughs of tall&nbsp;poplars.</p>
