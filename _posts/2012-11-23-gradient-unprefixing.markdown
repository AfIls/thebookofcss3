title:  "Gradient unprefixing"
---

In the past few months IE10, Firefox 16 and Opera 12.1 have all been released, and all have removed the vendor pre­fix from the four gradi­ent prop­er­ties: `linear-gradient`, `repeating-linear-gradient`, `radial-gradient`, and `repeating-radial-gradient`. As a res­ult, all of the examples in <a href="/resources/chapter-11/">Chapter 11</a> now use the new syn­tax. Only the WebKit-based browsers are yet to imple­ment the final syntax.
