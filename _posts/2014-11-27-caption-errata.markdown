A few captioning errors managed to sneak their way into the book:

- In _Figure 11-2_, the first direction should read ‘right to left’.
- _Figure 12-7_ should refer to the `scale()` function.
- _Figure 12-8_ should read: ‘Elements transformed by different values in the `skewX()` and `skewY()` functions’.
- _Figure 12-9_ should refer to the `matrix()` function.
- _Figure 13-3_ should refer to the `rotate3d()` function.
